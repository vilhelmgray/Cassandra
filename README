About
-----

Cassandra uses the Kelly criterion to determine the optimum betting
amount for a Texas hold 'em player during betting rounds.

Execution
---------

Cassandra handles only a single play of a poker hand; Cassandra must
be restarted for consecutive plays.

The first two prompts respectively request the player's current bankroll
and the effective pot of the current round; unsigned integer values are
expected. Even if the player has a blind (small or big) for the current
play, both of the bankroll and pot values must reflect the state of the
game at the player's first turn to act (i.e. after the blinds have been
posted).

Algorithm
---------

A 52-card deck is represented in memory as a 52-bit value, where each
bit represents a unique discrete card. The suits are broken into
four groups of contiguous bits; each group consisting of 13 bits
respectively representing the 13 discrete cards of the suit.

Licensing
---------

Cassandra is free software released under version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.
