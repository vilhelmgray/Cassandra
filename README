Cassandra uses the Kelly criterion to determine the optimum betting
amount for a Texas hold 'em player during betting rounds.

bit represents a unique discrete card. The suits are broken into
four groups of contiguous bits; each group consisting of 13 bits
respectively representing the 13 discrete cards of the suit.
