About
-----

Cassandra uses the Kelly criterion to determine the optimum betting
amount for a Texas hold 'em player during betting rounds.

Execution
---------

Cassandra handles only a single play of a poker hand; Cassandra must
be restarted for consecutive plays.

The first two prompts respectively request the player's current bankroll
and the retained pot of the current round; unsigned integer values are
expected. Even if the player has a blind (small or big) for the current
play, both the bankroll value and the pot value must reflect the state
of the game at the player's first turn to act -- i.e. after the blinds
have been posted.

The retained pot value is determined by multiplying the player's previous
bet amount by the number of bets placed by the opponents. Since blinds
are forced bets and result in a delayed first turn to act, the retained
pot value is only greater than zero when the player has a blind; in all
other situations, there are no previous bets placed by the player when it
is his or her first turn to act, so the retained pot amount is 0
(0 * number_of_opponent_bets = 0).

Algorithm
---------

A 52-card deck is represented in memory as a 52-bit value, where each
bit represents a unique discrete card. The suits are broken into
four groups of contiguous bits; each group consisting of 13 bits
respectively representing the 13 discrete cards of the suit.

---------
