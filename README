About
-----

Cassandra uses the Kelly criterion to determine the optimum betting
amount for a Texas hold 'em player during betting rounds.

Execution
---------

Cassandra handles only a single poker hand; Cassandra must be restarted
for consecutive poker hands.

The first two prompts respectively request the player's current bankroll
and the effective pot of the current round; unsigned integer values are
expected. If the player has a blind (big or small) for the current hand,
both of these values must reflect the state of the game after the first
round of betting for the current hand.

Algorithm
---------

A 52-card deck is represented in memory as a 52-bit value, where each
bit represents a unique discrete card. The suits are broken into
four groups of contiguous bits; each group consisting of 13 bits
respectively representing the 13 discrete cards of the suit.

Licensing
---------

Cassandra is free software released under version 3 of the GNU General
Public License.
